# Ui green audio player

  Audio player written in js.

  created based on pen created by Greg Hovanesyan([pen](https://codepen.io/gregh/pen/NdVvbm)). The original pen doesn't support multiple instances of player so rewrote the js to support multiple instances in a single page.

**Note:** For using the original js include the `singleinstance.js` from `js` folder.
